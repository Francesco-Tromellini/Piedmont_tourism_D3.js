            <h2>Comparison between Italian and foreign tourists</h2>
            <p>
            In the first graphic on the left we can see the number of arrivals per year relatives 
            to italian tourists, whereas on the second graphic on the right we see the same 
            data but this time computed on foreign travellers. 
            The general trend is, for the most part, similar: arrivals grow, especially in the last three years 
            before the pandemic, then they more than halve in 2020 and timidly grow back a little in 2021. 
            Nevertheless there is one major difference: in the years of the subprime crisis (2008 - 2010) 
            while there were less strangers coming to Piedmont for their holidays there was a spike of italian arrivals.

        <h2>Global trend of Piedmont's turism</h2>
        <p>
                In this third visualization it is possible to see how the general trend (Italians and foreigners added together)
                has always been growing from 2005 to 2019. Consequently, it can be noted that during the years of the subprime crisis,
                despite the collapse of foreign arrivals, the increase in Italian arrivals more than compensated, allowing
                the sector to continue to grow. Finally is also very clear from this bar chart that, with the pandemic, Piedmont's turists 
                arrivals more than halved: from more than 5 milion to less than 2.5 milion arrivals, and, even with a grow in 2021, they 
                remain below what they were in 2005.
