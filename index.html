            <h2>Comparison between Italian and foreign tourists</h2>
            In the first graphic on the left we can see the number of arrivals per year relatives 
            to italian tourists, <br> whereas on the second graphic on the right we see the same 
            data but this time computed on foreign travellers. <br>
            The general trend is, for the most part, similar: arrivals grow, especially in the last three years <br>
            before the pandemic, then they more than halve in 2020 and timidly grow back a little in 2021. <br>
            Nevertheless there is one major difference: in the years of the subprime crisis (2008 - 2010) <br>
            while there were less strangers coming to Piedmont for their holidays there was a spike of italian arrivals. <br>

            <h2>Global trend of Piedmont's turism</h2>
            <p>
                In this third view it is possible to see how the general trend (Italians and foreigners added together) <br>
                has always been growing from 2005 to 2019. Consequently, it can be noted that during the years of the subprime crisis, <br>
                despite the collapse of foreign arrivals, the increase in Italian arrivals more than compensated, allowing <br>
                the sector to continue to grow.
